The Cozie app can be customized in various ways:
1. [Custom watch surveys](/docs/custom_surveys/custom_watch_survey)
2. [Custom phone surveys](/docs/custom_surveys/custom_phone_survey)
3. [Custom backend and database](./custom_backend/custom_backend)
4. Modifying the source code (documentation not yet created)

The [custom watch surveys](/docs/custom_surveys/custom_watch_survey) and [custom phone surveys](/docs/custom_surveys/custom_phone_survey) are described in earlier sections as they are a core functionality of Cozie.

In [Design Decisions](./design_decisions), we have written down some of the decisions that we have made when creating Cozie. These notes might be helpful for people who want to modify or replicate Cozie.

We are still working on completing the remainder of the documentation. If you happen to want make use of custumizations that are not already documented, contact us at [cozie.app@gmail.com](mailto:cozie.app@gmail.com).
