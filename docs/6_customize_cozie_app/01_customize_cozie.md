The Cozie app can be customized in various ways:
1. [Custom watch surveys](/docs/custom_surveys/custom_watch_survey)
2. [Custom phone surveys](/docs/custom_surveys/custom_phone_survey)
3. Add your own OneSignal account for push notifications (documentation is coming soon)
4. Custom backend and database (documentation is coming soon)
5. Modifying the source code (documentation is coming soon)

The [custom watch surveys](/docs/custom_surveys/custom_watch_survey) and [custom phone surveys](/docs/custom_surveys/custom_phone_survey) are described in earlier sections as they are a core functionality of Cozie.

We are still working on completing the remainder of the documentation. If you happen to want make use of custumizations that are not already documented, contact us at [cozie.app@gmail.com](mailto:cozie.app@gmail.com).
