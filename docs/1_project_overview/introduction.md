## What is Cozie?

Cozie is an iOS App for for human comfort data collection. Users can provide feedback to surveys on the Apple Watch. It is extremely useful for conducting right-here-right-now surveys in buildings. It can, however, be used to ask questions in other settings, allowing people to provide feedback in real-time.

Cozie for iOS builds on the knowledge that the [BUDS Lab](https://www.budslab.org/) and [SinBerBEST](https://sinberbest.berkeley.edu) gained in developing [Cozie for Fitbit](https://cozie-fitbit.app).

Apple being one of the major players in wearable devices market and with the Apple Watch dominating the global smartwatch market share, we decided to develop Cozie for iOS. 

Cozie for Apple is available on the App Store. Please follow our [installation guide](installation) to get started.

## Tailor your survey

Choose the questions to display to the users by changing the [source code](https://github.com/cozie-app/cozie-apple) which open-source.
