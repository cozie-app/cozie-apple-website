We have successfully tested the Alpha version of Cozie and everything is working fine. We are now started testing the Beta version on the Apple Watch 6 and we are planning to open-source the code very soon.

Thank to all of you who help us testing the Alpha version.

Please use the link in the home page to contact me if you are interested and would like to learn more or to contribute to the project.
