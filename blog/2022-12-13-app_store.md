Cozie is now available on the official [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/cozie/id1625029501). Thank you to all of you who help us test during the development

Until now, Cozie for Apple has been deployed four times in research experiments with up to 50 participants and counting.

We have updated the documentation for [installation](/docs/installation), [setup](/docs/setup), and [data retrieval](/docs/download_data/data_download_offline). We are still working on updating the documentation for customization of Cozie.
