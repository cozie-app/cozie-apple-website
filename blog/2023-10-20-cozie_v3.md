We are happy to announce that we have published version three of Cozie-Apple. We worked towards a cleaner, simpler code base in the app and the backend while also improving reliability. We have already started working with Cozie v3 and it is already deployed for research.

## New features in Cozie v3  
* New HealthKit [data points](/docs/download_data/data_overview)
  * Heart rate variability (HRV)
  * Wrist temperature
  * Sleep analysis
* [Offline data logging (in-app file download)](/docs/download_data/data_download_offline)
* [Customizable backend configuration in the app](/docs/customize_cozie_app/customize_cozie)
