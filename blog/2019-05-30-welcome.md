Welcome to Cozie Apple. I am currently working on a Alpha version of Cozie
Apple and I am planning to release it by the end of 2020.

Please contact me if you are interested and would like to learn more or to contribute to the project.

Cozie Apple is iOS app for human comfort data collection.

Cozie Apple complements the [Cozie clock face for Fitbit](https://cozie.app). With Apple
dominating the global smartwatch market share we decided to develop Cozie Apple.

Cozie Apple will include the following functionalities, such as:
* The consent procedure will be enbedded in the app, using Apple Research Kit.
* Push notifications.
* Integration with all the Apple watch sensors.
* Integration with Apple Health Kit.
